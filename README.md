# -Application-of-Active-Infrared-Imaging-for-Breast-Cancer-Screening
In a research endeavor dedicated to enhancing breast cancer screening methodologies, I strategically employed cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to augment diagnostic capabilities. My responsibilities encompassed harnessing the Bioheat Transfer module within COMSOL to simulate thermal wave propagation on a model representing women's breasts. This intricate process involved configuring intricate models, delineating precise boundary conditions, and executing simulations to scrutinize thermal wave dynamics.

Prior to inputting breast images into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) equipped with loopy map feature, I executed crucial preprocessing procedures to optimize the model's efficacy. Standard image preprocessing steps, such as resizing to a predefined dimension, pixel value normalization, and grayscale conversion as necessary, were diligently performed using OpenCV, a renowned Python library for image processing tasks.

Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, notably Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in conjunction with MATLAB, I transformed medical data into grayscale representations suitable for in-depth analysis. Subsequently, I devised algorithms to extract temperature profiles from video sequences, capturing dynamic temperature fluctuations indicative of underlying tumors. Employing cross-correlation analysis methodologies, I meticulously compared temperature patterns to discern optimal coefficients for discriminating tumors across diverse stages, sizes, and depths. This rigorous process entailed fine-tuning correlation parameters and refining analysis techniques to yield precise diagnostic outcomes.

The culmination of these efforts resulted in the development of a robust CNN-based classifier, trained on a comprehensive dataset of breast images, achieving an impressive 77% accuracy rate in tumor identification. The integration of the groundbreaking Linear Frequency-Modulated Thermal Wave Imaging Technique, coupled with the sophisticated CNN-based tumor classification system in MATLAB, marked a significant leap forward in the realm of breast cancer screening, promising enhanced diagnostic precision and clinical efficacy.
